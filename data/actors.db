In much the same way that an animated skeleton is returned from the dead so too are zombies shunted back into this world.&nbsp; While a skilled spellcaster may animate the dead and command the newly awakened, zombies may also rise in areas of the world saturated with necromantic energy.&nbsp; In this situation, the zombies will not obey the command of a master, but roam aimlessly in a small area until they either find something to attack and consume or rot away into a pile of inanimate bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Re: Your Brains.</strong> Zombies do retain quite a lot of their former selves in regards to their physical appearance.&nbsp; Zombies will still show the wounds or disease scars which slew them upon reanimating.&nbsp; The symptoms of decay will also be present as many freshly spawned zombies will be bloated, have patches of skin sloughing from their bodies, or even trailing entrails from exploded abdomens.&nbsp; While a zombie may resemble the person they were before, there is nothing at work within the head except mindless hunger.&nbsp; Zombies stumble through their existence in a perpetual state of mindlessness only able to heed their master&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp; This fact of the zombie&rsquo;s mind makes them invaluable warriors for a necromancer in need.&nbsp; Zombies are direct and will shamble off towards their quarry without so much as a second thought to their own safety.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been noted that some zombies have walked through fires or pits of acid in order to reach their enemies.&nbsp; Once they reach their target, zombies will pummel and bite at their enemy until either they or the enemy fall in the tussle.&nbsp; Zombies may also wield weapons, though not cleverly; zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.&nbsp; The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!&nbsp; Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":"Undead","environment":"Urban","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 316","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"sdnkpfw50MeOAwau","sort":600000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Zombie","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"87fIbUJmQ0qqjuQn","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"Ed7XgnZu9qRs3qdn","name":"Slam","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

I swear it's true!!!\"</p>\n<p>- Unknown Disorderly Patron at the Brass Buck Tavern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>What more could be said about the humble crab than is not already common knowledge to those who live near or frequent the coasts of the continent. Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human's hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n</section>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab's ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar's eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Coastal","cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 324","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":2,"total":4},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"sdnkpfw50MeOAwau","sort":300000,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.AOJvmk1IchxNxQzP"}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/GiantCrab.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Giant Crab","displayName":20,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/GiantCrab.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":30,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"IZFwq6dLQzHrocco","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"NsbkrfEUPw2pbRZ3","name":"Amphibious","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The crab can breathe air and water.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":"","type":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":"","value":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell","value":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":200000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/emerald_05.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"7qDtYuaBNQ3zOnBC","name":"Claw","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes.

Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color: #47d18c;\"><a style=\"color: #47d18c;\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &ldquo;Your Spellbook&rdquo; sidebar).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\r\n</blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Wizard","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":700000,"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":410,"dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":3,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Wizard"}}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/violet_08.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"oUgXYzjKmnTxX8MP","name":"Arcane Recovery","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.

Varying from the size of a mouse to that of a house cat, bats have a unique feature amongst mammals: the gift of flight! Stretched thin between needle-thin boney “hands” are fleshy membranes which span out wide from the bat’s delicate body, allowing the bats to take to the skies in search of insects and woodland fruits to indulge upon.</p>\n<p><strong>Chitter Chatter.</strong> Presumed blind by many from nonsense tales told to children, bats have eyesight nearly akin to our own, though notably less sharp. What makes these creatures truly unique is their ability to navigate in the pitch black of night. The bats utilize a series of chirps and screeches researchers have dubbed “echolocation” to pinpoint objects or prey within their flightpath. The echolocation chirps emitted by the bats bounce back towards the tiny creature’s proportionally massive ears, allowing the bats to make split second corrections to their navigation without the aid of their eyes. It should be again noted that the bat makes a clever familiar choice, as they may navigate those places too dim and dangerous for our mortal eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten

If you roll an odd number, one random creature within 30 feet of you (not including you) takes force damage equal to the number rolled. If no other creatures are in range, you take the damage.<h3>Chaos Bolt</h3><p>You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack’s damage type, as shown below.</p>\r\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d8</th>\r\n<th>Damage Type</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td>Acid</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>Cold</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>Fire</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n<td>Force</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>Lightning</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n<td>Poison</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>7</td>\r\n<td>Psychic</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>8</td>\r\n<td>Thunder</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it.

From a young age I suffered nightmares. Dreams of battles, watching men and women I did not recognise fall besides me and waking in terror and grief. My only solace was my mother, who was loving to me and helped me to overcome the terror I felt, but died very suddenly when I was 14, and after that I relied solely on my brother for familial affection. Our father never had time for us, partially due to his position, but I felt that when I did meet his gaze, all he could see was my mother in the light blue eyes I had of hers. My brother shared his brown eyes and would often sit with him during public gatherings, I was always welcome but kept my distance. \n\nUpon coming of age I was entered into the test of Siberys, and despite many days of unbearable stress, my DragonMark did not manifest. I started to prepare for my life as a BattleSmith Artificer, knowing that without my mark I could never take my fathers place as Baron, but could one day lead a Cannith Army, if the Korth Edicts continued to fade until they become only a memory of the past. I trained myself in Martial combat and Smithing and my brother often would come visit me at the forge as I worked long hours for no pay. He had manifested his mark early into the tests and was occupied with his baron training and education for most of his days. When we could both get away we would sit together at the docks and pass the time trading stories of our trainings, and I even taught him a thing or two about fighting as he described the politics of the houses.\n\n\nIt was during one of these divagations that a band of rogues took it upon themselves to abduct my brother. They descended upon us like shadows and before we knew it I was on the ground watching them pull my brother away. I felt a surge of panic and anger, and an intolerable pain like a burning brand on my forehead. I had felt hot iron before but this pain was different, worse. I managed to open my eyes through the pain, expecting to see the wielder of this weapon, but as I looked all I saw was a green light, before the darkness at the edge of my vision enveloped me and I lost consciousness.\n\n\nI awoke in the back of a wagon, the words \"Hey, you. You're finally awake\" brought my surroundings into focus. It was one of my father's advisers. He had always been kind to me and often had helped fill the void left by my mother with games of strategy and chance. He was sitting in the back of the wagon with me and explained what had happened. My eyes widened with horror as I learned that the burning I had felt was not a spell used against me, but was rather the manifestation of my dragonmark, my aberrant dragonmark. As the rouges had wrestled with my still struggling brother, I had unleashed a fountain of acid, straight from my forehead, not only severely burning and causing the would be captors to flea, but also disfiguring the arms and legs of my brother, who was only protected by the clothes he wore and the hood the had pulled over his head. He was recovering but had not yet regained consciousness. Upon the discovery of the scene my father had realised the significance of the mark, it meant that I was not in fact his son, but rather the product of unfaithful actions of his departed wife. This and the severe injuries I had caused to my brother meant I was no longer a d'Cannith, and no longer welcome in the House of Cannith. My exile had begun. \n\n\nDuring my exile I turned to religion. Without a purpose anymore I felt that perhaps the Holy path would give me something to focus on, and explored many of the religious organisations throughout east Khorvaire. I never settled on one that felt like it called to me, but I learned about mediation and the power of a peaceful mind. Soon I departed society as a whole and lived in seclusion on the banks of lake glass. There I focused on my mediation and through it realised my psionic powers. I learned that there was a spirit inside of me, the spirit of a warrior. This spirit was what had driven me in my youth to pursue Artificing, and it was the source of my violent dreams. The first time I truly connected to my spirit through meditation my eyes turned a bright red, and they never returned to my mothers light blue. I learned that knowledge was powerful, and traded all I could with other wanders to learn about my spirit, my mark and artificing. Many years past in my solitude, and I learned the nature of my spirit, How to control the powers my mark had given me and how to form magic into my creations. \n\n\nI missed my brother immensely and often tried to reach out to him telepathically, to no avail. I learned little of what became of him and my father. When I did travel into society, small farm communities and the like, I was always met with fear. My mark was always clearly visible on my forehead, and my dark red eyes give me a menacing appearance. I try to always do good for others, but learnt that often the only way to help was to do it without notice, often fabricating devices and spells to assist those in need and departing before anyone even noticed. Humorously to me many of my deeds were considered works of deities, and it appeared I became the silent unknown patron of many local beliefs. I was at peace. \n\n\nOne day in my studies I came across information regarding aberrant dragonmarks. There was supposedly a teacher in the south of khorvaire that could  remove your dragonmark from your skin. I thought to my family, and to all those who feared me because of the mark, and decided to investigate this further. I packed up my belongings and headed out into the world once again. \n\n\n\n</p>","public":"<h1>Background: Hermit</h1><p><p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You lived in seclusion &mdash; either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone &mdash; for a formative part of your life.

From a young age I suffered nightmares. Dreams of battles, watching men and women I did not recognise fall besides me and waking in terror and grief. My only solace was my mother, who was loving to me and helped me to overcome the terror I felt, but died very suddenly when I was 14, and after that I relied solely on my brother for familial affection. Our father never had time for us, partially due to his position, but I felt that when I did meet his gaze, all he could see was my mother in the light blue eyes I had of hers. My brother shared his brown eyes and would often sit with him during public gatherings, I was always welcome but kept my distance. \n\nUpon coming of age I was entered into the test of Siberys, and despite many days of unbearable stress, my DragonMark did not manifest. I started to prepare for my life as a BattleSmith Artificer, knowing that without my mark I could never take my fathers place as Baron, but could one day lead a Cannith Army, if the Korth Edicts continued to fade until they become only a memory of the past. I trained myself in Martial combat and Smithing and my brother often would come visit me at the forge as I worked long hours for no pay. He had manifested his mark early into the tests and was occupied with his baron training and education for most of his days. When we could both get away we would sit together at the docks and pass the time trading stories of our trainings, and I even taught him a thing or two about fighting as he described the politics of the houses.\n\n\nIt was during one of these divagations that a band of rogues took it upon themselves to abduct my brother. They descended upon us like shadows and before we knew it I was on the ground watching them pull my brother away. I felt a surge of panic and anger, and an intolerable pain like a burning brand on my forehead. I had felt hot iron before but this pain was different, worse. I managed to open my eyes through the pain, expecting to see the wielder of this weapon, but as I looked all I saw was a green light, before the darkness at the edge of my vision enveloped me and I lost consciousness.\n\n\nI awoke in the back of a wagon, the words \"Hey, you. You're finally awake\" brought my surroundings into focus. It was one of my father's advisers. He had always been kind to me and often had helped fill the void left by my mother with games of strategy and chance. He was sitting in the back of the wagon with me and explained what had happened. My eyes widened with horror as I learned that the burning I had felt was not a spell used against me, but was rather the manifestation of my dragonmark, my aberrant dragonmark. As the rouges had wrestled with my still struggling brother, I had unleashed a fountain of acid, straight from my forehead, not only severely burning and causing the would be captors to flea, but also disfiguring the arms and legs of my brother, who was only protected by the clothes he wore and the hood the had pulled over his head. He was recovering but had not yet regained consciousness. Upon the discovery of the scene my father had realised the significance of the mark, it meant that I was not in fact his son, but rather the product of unfaithful actions of his departed wife. This and the severe injuries I had caused to my brother meant I was no longer a d'Cannith, and no longer welcome in the House of Cannith. My exile had begun. \n\n\nDuring my exile I turned to religion. Without a purpose anymore I felt that perhaps the Holy path would give me something to focus on, and explored many of the religious organisations throughout east Khorvaire. I never settled on one that felt like it called to me, but I learned about mediation and the power of a peaceful mind. Soon I departed society as a whole and lived in seclusion on the banks of lake glass. There I focused on my mediation and through it realised my psionic powers. I learned that there was a spirit inside of me, the spirit of a warrior. This spirit was what had driven me in my youth to pursue Artificing, and it was the source of my violent dreams. The first time I truly connected to my spirit through meditation my eyes turned a bright red, and they never returned to my mothers light blue. I learned that knowledge was powerful, and traded all I could with other wanders to learn about my spirit, my mark and artificing. Many years past in my solitude, and I learned the nature of my spirit, How to control the powers my mark had given me and how to form magic into my creations. \n\n\nI missed my brother immensely and often tried to reach out to him telepathically, to no avail. I learned little of what became of him and my father. When I did travel into society, small farm communities and the like, I was always met with fear. My mark was always clearly visible on my forehead, and my dark red eyes give me a menacing appearance. I try to always do good for others, but learnt that often the only way to help was to do it without notice, often fabricating devices and spells to assist those in need and departing before anyone even noticed. Humorously to me many of my deeds were considered works of deities, and it appeared I became the silent unknown patron of many local beliefs. I was at peace. \n\n\nOne day in my studies I came across information regarding aberrant dragonmarks. There was supposedly a teacher in the south of khorvaire that could  remove your dragonmark from your skin. I thought to my family, and to all those who feared me because of the mark, and decided to investigate this further. I packed up my belongings and headed out into the world once again. \n\n\n\n</p>"},"alignment":"Neutral Good","race":"Kalashtar","background":"Hermit","xp":{"value":300,"min":0,"max":300},"appearance":"Gender: Male\nEyes: Dark Red, almost Brown\nHeight: 6'\nFaith: n/a\nHair: Brown\nSkin: Light Tan\nAge: 38\nWeight: 168\n\nnull","trait":"Loves solitude\n\nHelps other anonymously \n\nNever remembers a face","ideal":"Greater Good.

Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC&nbsp;</span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier&nbsp;</span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>","resultString":"","definitions":[]},{"id":1131631,"componentId":null,"componentTypeId":null,"damageTypeId":null,"text":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions.

From a young age I suffered nightmares. Dreams of battles, watching men and women I did not recognise fall besides me and waking in terror and grief. My only solace was my mother, who was loving to me and helped me to overcome the terror I felt, but died very suddenly when I was 14, and after that I relied solely on my brother for familial affection. Our father never had time for us, partially due to his position, but I felt that when I did meet his gaze, all he could see was my mother in the light blue eyes I had of hers. My brother shared his brown eyes and would often sit with him during public gatherings, I was always welcome but kept my distance. \n\nUpon coming of age I was entered into the test of Siberys, and despite many days of unbearable stress, my DragonMark did not manifest. I started to prepare for my life as a BattleSmith Artificer, knowing that without my mark I could never take my fathers place as Baron, but could one day lead a Cannith Army, if the Korth Edicts continued to fade until they become only a memory of the past. I trained myself in Martial combat and Smithing and my brother often would come visit me at the forge as I worked long hours for no pay. He had manifested his mark early into the tests and was occupied with his baron training and education for most of his days. When we could both get away we would sit together at the docks and pass the time trading stories of our trainings, and I even taught him a thing or two about fighting as he described the politics of the houses.\n\n\nIt was during one of these divagations that a band of rogues took it upon themselves to abduct my brother. They descended upon us like shadows and before we knew it I was on the ground watching them pull my brother away. I felt a surge of panic and anger, and an intolerable pain like a burning brand on my forehead. I had felt hot iron before but this pain was different, worse. I managed to open my eyes through the pain, expecting to see the wielder of this weapon, but as I looked all I saw was a green light, before the darkness at the edge of my vision enveloped me and I lost consciousness.\n\n\nI awoke in the back of a wagon, the words \"Hey, you. You're finally awake\" brought my surroundings into focus. It was one of my father's advisers. He had always been kind to me and often had helped fill the void left by my mother with games of strategy and chance. He was sitting in the back of the wagon with me and explained what had happened. My eyes widened with horror as I learned that the burning I had felt was not a spell used against me, but was rather the manifestation of my dragonmark, my aberrant dragonmark. As the rouges had wrestled with my still struggling brother, I had unleashed a fountain of acid, straight from my forehead, not only severely burning and causing the would be captors to flea, but also disfiguring the arms and legs of my brother, who was only protected by the clothes he wore and the hood the had pulled over his head. He was recovering but had not yet regained consciousness. Upon the discovery of the scene my father had realised the significance of the mark, it meant that I was not in fact his son, but rather the product of unfaithful actions of his departed wife. This and the severe injuries I had caused to my brother meant I was no longer a d'Cannith, and no longer welcome in the House of Cannith. My exile had begun. \n\n\nDuring my exile I turned to religion. Without a purpose anymore I felt that perhaps the Holy path would give me something to focus on, and explored many of the religious organisations throughout east Khorvaire. I never settled on one that felt like it called to me, but I learned about mediation and the power of a peaceful mind. Soon I departed society as a whole and lived in seclusion on the banks of lake glass. There I focused on my mediation and through it realised my psionic powers. I learned that there was a spirit inside of me, the spirit of a warrior. This spirit was what had driven me in my youth to pursue Artificing, and it was the source of my violent dreams. The first time I truly connected to my spirit through meditation my eyes turned a bright red, and they never returned to my mothers light blue. I learned that knowledge was powerful, and traded all I could with other wanders to learn about my spirit, my mark and artificing. Many years past in my solitude, and I learned the nature of my spirit, How to control the powers my mark had given me and how to form magic into my creations. \n\n\nI missed my brother immensely and often tried to reach out to him telepathically, to no avail. I learned little of what became of him and my father. When I did travel into society, small farm communities and the like, I was always met with fear. My mark was always clearly visible on my forehead, and my dark red eyes give me a menacing appearance. I try to always do good for others, but learnt that often the only way to help was to do it without notice, often fabricating devices and spells to assist those in need and departing before anyone even noticed. Humorously to me many of my deeds were considered works of deities, and it appeared I became the silent unknown patron of many local beliefs. I was at peace. \n\n\nOne day in my studies I came across information regarding aberrant dragonmarks. There was supposedly a teacher in the south of khorvaire that could  remove your dragonmark from your skin.

From a young age I suffered nightmares. Dreams of battles, watching men and women I did not recognise fall besides me and waking in terror and grief. My only solace was my mother, who was loving to me and helped me to overcome the terror I felt, but died very suddenly when I was 14, and after that I relied solely on my brother for familial affection. Our father never had time for us, partially due to his position, but I felt that when I did meet his gaze, all he could see was my mother in the light blue eyes I had of hers. My brother shared his brown eyes and would often sit with him during public gatherings, I was always welcome but kept my distance. \n\nUpon coming of age I was entered into the test of Siberys, and despite many days of unbearable stress, my DragonMark did not manifest. I started to prepare for my life as a BattleSmith Artificer, knowing that without my mark I could never take my fathers place as Baron, but could one day lead a Cannith Army, if the Korth Edicts continued to fade until they become only a memory of the past. I trained myself in Martial combat and Smithing and my brother often would come visit me at the forge as I worked long hours for no pay. He had manifested his mark early into the tests and was occupied with his baron training and education for most of his days. When we could both get away we would sit together at the docks and pass the time trading stories of our trainings, and I even taught him a thing or two about fighting as he described the politics of the houses.\n\n\nIt was during one of these divagations that a band of rogues took it upon themselves to abduct my brother. They descended upon us like shadows and before we knew it I was on the ground watching them pull my brother away. I felt a surge of panic and anger, and an intolerable pain like a burning brand on my forehead. I had felt hot iron before but this pain was different, worse. I managed to open my eyes through the pain, expecting to see the wielder of this weapon, but as I looked all I saw was a green light, before the darkness at the edge of my vision enveloped me and I lost consciousness.\n\n\nI awoke in the back of a wagon, the words \"Hey, you. You're finally awake\" brought my surroundings into focus. It was one of my father's advisers. He had always been kind to me and often had helped fill the void left by my mother with games of strategy and chance. He was sitting in the back of the wagon with me and explained what had happened. My eyes widened with horror as I learned that the burning I had felt was not a spell used against me, but was rather the manifestation of my dragonmark, my aberrant dragonmark. As the rouges had wrestled with my still struggling brother, I had unleashed a fountain of acid, straight from my forehead, not only severely burning and causing the would be captors to flea, but also disfiguring the arms and legs of my brother, who was only protected by the clothes he wore and the hood the had pulled over his head. He was recovering but had not yet regained consciousness. Upon the discovery of the scene my father had realised the significance of the mark, it meant that I was not in fact his son, but rather the product of unfaithful actions of his departed wife. This and the severe injuries I had caused to my brother meant I was no longer a d'Cannith, and no longer welcome in the House of Cannith. My exile had begun. \n\n\nDuring my exile I turned to religion. Without a purpose anymore I felt that perhaps the Holy path would give me something to focus on, and explored many of the religious organisations throughout east Khorvaire. I never settled on one that felt like it called to me, but I learned about mediation and the power of a peaceful mind. Soon I departed society as a whole and lived in seclusion on the banks of lake glass. There I focused on my mediation and through it realised my psionic powers. I learned that there was a spirit inside of me, the spirit of a warrior. This spirit was what had driven me in my youth to pursue Artificing, and it was the source of my violent dreams. The first time I truly connected to my spirit through meditation my eyes turned a bright red, and they never returned to my mothers light blue. I learned that knowledge was powerful, and traded all I could with other wanders to learn about my spirit, my mark and artificing. Many years past in my solitude, and I learned the nature of my spirit, How to control the powers my mark had given me and how to form magic into my creations. \n\n\nI missed my brother immensely and often tried to reach out to him telepathically, to no avail. I learned little of what became of him and my father. When I did travel into society, small farm communities and the like, I was always met with fear. My mark was always clearly visible on my forehead, and my dark red eyes give me a menacing appearance. I try to always do good for others, but learnt that often the only way to help was to do it without notice, often fabricating devices and spells to assist those in need and departing before anyone even noticed. Humorously to me many of my deeds were considered works of deities, and it appeared I became the silent unknown patron of many local beliefs. I was at peace. \n\n\nOne day in my studies I came across information regarding aberrant dragonmarks. There was supposedly a teacher in the south of khorvaire that could  remove your dragonmark from your skin. I thought to my family, and to all those who feared me because of the mark, and decided to investigate this further. I packed up my belongings and headed out into the world once again. \n\n\n\n</p>"},"alignment":"Neutral Good","race":"Kalashtar","background":"Hermit","xp":{"value":300,"min":0,"max":300},"appearance":"Gender: Male\nEyes: Dark Red, almost Brown\nHeight: 6'\nFaith: n/a\nHair: Brown\nSkin: Light Tan\nAge: 38\nWeight: 168\n\nnull","trait":"Loves solitude\n\nHelps other anonymously \n\nNever remembers a face","ideal":"Greater Good.

If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.</p>","resultString":"","definitions":[]},{"id":1131501,"componentId":null,"componentTypeId":null,"damageTypeId":null,"text":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have studied the workings of magic and how to channel it through objects. As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus&mdash;specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool&mdash;in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an &lsquo;M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,&rdquo; in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of&nbsp;the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC&nbsp;</span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier&nbsp;</span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>","resultString":"","definitions":[]},{"id":1131631,"componentId":null,"componentTypeId":null,"damageTypeId":null,"text":"<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions.

An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see &ldquo;<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day).

You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time.

Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC&nbsp;</span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier&nbsp;</span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Artificer","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":700000,"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":1131501,"dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Artificer"}}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/violet_08.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"NkXvs3RqRvD3feFs","name":"Artificer Infusions","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item.</p>\r\n<p>The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p>\r\n<p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level.

From a young age I suffered nightmares. Dreams of battles, watching men and women I did not recognise fall besides me and waking in terror and grief. My only solace was my mother, who was loving to me and helped me to overcome the terror I felt, but died very suddenly when I was 14, and after that I relied solely on my brother for familial affection. Our father never had time for us, partially due to his position, but I felt that when I did meet his gaze, all he could see was my mother in the light blue eyes I had of hers. My brother shared his brown eyes and would often sit with him during public gatherings, I was always welcome but kept my distance. \n\nUpon coming of age I was entered into the test of Siberys, and despite many days of unbearable stress, my DragonMark did not manifest. I started to prepare for my life as a BattleSmith Artificer, knowing that without my mark I could never take my fathers place as Baron, but could one day lead a Cannith Army, if the Korth Edicts continued to fade until they become only a memory of the past. I trained myself in Martial combat and Smithing and my brother often would come visit me at the forge as I worked long hours for no pay. He had manifested his mark early into the tests and was occupied with his baron training and education for most of his days. When we could both get away we would sit together at the docks and pass the time trading stories of our trainings, and I even taught him a thing or two about fighting as he described the politics of the houses.\n\n\nIt was during one of these divagations that a band of rogues took it upon themselves to abduct my brother. They descended upon us like shadows and before we knew it I was on the ground watching them pull my brother away. I felt a surge of panic and anger, and an intolerable pain like a burning brand on my forehead. I had felt hot iron before but this pain was different, worse. I managed to open my eyes through the pain, expecting to see the wielder of this weapon, but as I looked all I saw was a green light, before the darkness at the edge of my vision enveloped me and I lost consciousness.\n\n\nI awoke in the back of a wagon, the words \"Hey, you. You're finally awake\" brought my surroundings into focus. It was one of my father's advisers. He had always been kind to me and often had helped fill the void left by my mother with games of strategy and chance. He was sitting in the back of the wagon with me and explained what had happened. My eyes widened with horror as I learned that the burning I had felt was not a spell used against me, but was rather the manifestation of my dragonmark, my aberrant dragonmark. As the rouges had wrestled with my still struggling brother, I had unleashed a fountain of acid, straight from my forehead, not only severely burning and causing the would be captors to flea, but also disfiguring the arms and legs of my brother, who was only protected by the clothes he wore and the hood the had pulled over his head. He was recovering but had not yet regained consciousness. Upon the discovery of the scene my father had realised the significance of the mark, it meant that I was not in fact his son, but rather the product of unfaithful actions of his departed wife. This and the severe injuries I had caused to my brother meant I was no longer a d'Cannith, and no longer welcome in the House of Cannith. My exile had begun. \n\n\nDuring my exile I turned to religion. Without a purpose anymore I felt that perhaps the Holy path would give me something to focus on, and explored many of the religious organisations throughout east Khorvaire. I never settled on one that felt like it called to me, but I learned about mediation and the power of a peaceful mind. Soon I departed society as a whole and lived in seclusion on the banks of lake glass. There I focused on my mediation and through it realised my psionic powers. I learned that there was a spirit inside of me, the spirit of a warrior. This spirit was what had driven me in my youth to pursue Artificing, and it was the source of my violent dreams. The first time I truly connected to my spirit through meditation my eyes turned a bright red, and they never returned to my mothers light blue. I learned that knowledge was powerful, and traded all I could with other wanders to learn about my spirit, my mark and artificing. Many years past in my solitude, and I learned the nature of my spirit, How to control the powers my mark had given me and how to form magic into my creations. \n\n\nI missed my brother immensely and often tried to reach out to him telepathically, to no avail. I learned little of what became of him and my father. When I did travel into society, small farm communities and the like, I was always met with fear. My mark was always clearly visible on my forehead, and my dark red eyes give me a menacing appearance. I try to always do good for others, but learnt that often the only way to help was to do it without notice, often fabricating devices and spells to assist those in need and departing before anyone even noticed. Humorously to me many of my deeds were considered works of deities, and it appeared I became the silent unknown patron of many local beliefs. I was at peace. \n\n\nOne day in my studies I came across information regarding aberrant dragonmarks. There was supposedly a teacher in the south of khorvaire that could  remove your dragonmark from your skin. I thought to my family, and to all those who feared me because of the mark, and decided to investigate this further. I packed up my belongings and headed out into the world once again. \n\n\n\n</p>","public":"<h1>Background: Hermit</h1><p><p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You lived in seclusion &mdash; either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone &mdash; for a formative part of your life.

From a young age I suffered nightmares. Dreams of battles, watching men and women I did not recognise fall besides me and waking in terror and grief. My only solace was my mother, who was loving to me and helped me to overcome the terror I felt, but died very suddenly when I was 14, and after that I relied solely on my brother for familial affection. Our father never had time for us, partially due to his position, but I felt that when I did meet his gaze, all he could see was my mother in the light blue eyes I had of hers. My brother shared his brown eyes and would often sit with him during public gatherings, I was always welcome but kept my distance. \n\nUpon coming of age I was entered into the test of Siberys, and despite many days of unbearable stress, my DragonMark did not manifest. I started to prepare for my life as a BattleSmith Artificer, knowing that without my mark I could never take my fathers place as Baron, but could one day lead a Cannith Army, if the Korth Edicts continued to fade until they become only a memory of the past. I trained myself in Martial combat and Smithing and my brother often would come visit me at the forge as I worked long hours for no pay. He had manifested his mark early into the tests and was occupied with his baron training and education for most of his days. When we could both get away we would sit together at the docks and pass the time trading stories of our trainings, and I even taught him a thing or two about fighting as he described the politics of the houses.\n\n\nIt was during one of these divagations that a band of rogues took it upon themselves to abduct my brother. They descended upon us like shadows and before we knew it I was on the ground watching them pull my brother away. I felt a surge of panic and anger, and an intolerable pain like a burning brand on my forehead. I had felt hot iron before but this pain was different, worse. I managed to open my eyes through the pain, expecting to see the wielder of this weapon, but as I looked all I saw was a green light, before the darkness at the edge of my vision enveloped me and I lost consciousness.\n\n\nI awoke in the back of a wagon, the words \"Hey, you. You're finally awake\" brought my surroundings into focus. It was one of my father's advisers. He had always been kind to me and often had helped fill the void left by my mother with games of strategy and chance. He was sitting in the back of the wagon with me and explained what had happened. My eyes widened with horror as I learned that the burning I had felt was not a spell used against me, but was rather the manifestation of my dragonmark, my aberrant dragonmark. As the rouges had wrestled with my still struggling brother, I had unleashed a fountain of acid, straight from my forehead, not only severely burning and causing the would be captors to flea, but also disfiguring the arms and legs of my brother, who was only protected by the clothes he wore and the hood the had pulled over his head. He was recovering but had not yet regained consciousness. Upon the discovery of the scene my father had realised the significance of the mark, it meant that I was not in fact his son, but rather the product of unfaithful actions of his departed wife. This and the severe injuries I had caused to my brother meant I was no longer a d'Cannith, and no longer welcome in the House of Cannith. My exile had begun. \n\n\nDuring my exile I turned to religion. Without a purpose anymore I felt that perhaps the Holy path would give me something to focus on, and explored many of the religious organisations throughout east Khorvaire. I never settled on one that felt like it called to me, but I learned about mediation and the power of a peaceful mind. Soon I departed society as a whole and lived in seclusion on the banks of lake glass. There I focused on my mediation and through it realised my psionic powers. I learned that there was a spirit inside of me, the spirit of a warrior. This spirit was what had driven me in my youth to pursue Artificing, and it was the source of my violent dreams. The first time I truly connected to my spirit through meditation my eyes turned a bright red, and they never returned to my mothers light blue. I learned that knowledge was powerful, and traded all I could with other wanders to learn about my spirit, my mark and artificing. Many years past in my solitude, and I learned the nature of my spirit, How to control the powers my mark had given me and how to form magic into my creations. \n\n\nI missed my brother immensely and often tried to reach out to him telepathically, to no avail. I learned little of what became of him and my father. When I did travel into society, small farm communities and the like, I was always met with fear. My mark was always clearly visible on my forehead, and my dark red eyes give me a menacing appearance. I try to always do good for others, but learnt that often the only way to help was to do it without notice, often fabricating devices and spells to assist those in need and departing before anyone even noticed. Humorously to me many of my deeds were considered works of deities, and it appeared I became the silent unknown patron of many local beliefs. I was at peace. \n\n\nOne day in my studies I came across information regarding aberrant dragonmarks. There was supposedly a teacher in the south of khorvaire that could  remove your dragonmark from your skin. I thought to my family, and to all those who feared me because of the mark, and decided to investigate this further. I packed up my belongings and headed out into the world once again. \n\n\n\n</p>"},"alignment":"Neutral Good","race":"Kalashtar","background":"Hermit","xp":{"value":300,"min":0,"max":300},"appearance":"Gender: Male\nEyes: Dark Red, almost Brown\nHeight: 6'\nFaith: n/a\nHair: Brown\nSkin: Light Tan\nAge: 38\nWeight: 168\n\nnull","trait":"Loves solitude\n\nHelps other anonymously \n\nNever remembers a face","ideal":"Greater Good.

You must have a spellcasting focus&mdash;specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool&mdash;in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an &lsquo;M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,&rdquo; in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of&nbsp;the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill.

The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p>","resultString":"","definitions":[]},{"id":"1030748","entityTypeId":"222216831","componentId":2148553,"componentTypeId":1960452172,"damageTypeId":null,"text":"When you’re using Mind Link to speak telepathically to a creature, you can use your action to give that creature the ability to speak telepathically with you for 1 hour or until you end this effect as an action.

As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus&mdash;specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool&mdash;in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an &lsquo;M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,&rdquo; in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of&nbsp;the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC&nbsp;</span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier&nbsp;</span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Artificer","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":700000,"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":1131501,"dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Artificer"}}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/violet_08.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"NkXvs3RqRvD3feFs","name":"Artificer Infusions","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item.</p>\r\n<p>The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p>\r\n<p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level.

If you roll an odd number, one random creature within 30 feet of you (not including you) takes force damage equal to the number rolled. If no other creatures are in range, you take the damage.<h3>Chaos Bolt</h3><p>You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack’s damage type, as shown below.</p>\r\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d8</th>\r\n<th>Damage Type</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td>Acid</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>Cold</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>Fire</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n<td>Force</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>Lightning</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n<td>Poison</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>7</td>\r\n<td>Psychic</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>8</td>\r\n<td>Thunder</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it.

From a young age I suffered nightmares. Dreams of battles, watching men and women I did not recognise fall besides me and waking in terror and grief. My only solace was my mother, who was loving to me and helped me to overcome the terror I felt, but died very suddenly when I was 14, and after that I relied solely on my brother for familial affection. Our father never had time for us, partially due to his position, but I felt that when I did meet his gaze, all he could see was my mother in the light blue eyes I had of hers. My brother shared his brown eyes and would often sit with him during public gatherings, I was always welcome but kept my distance. \n\nUpon coming of age I was entered into the test of Siberys, and despite many days of unbearable stress, my DragonMark did not manifest. I started to prepare for my life as a BattleSmith Artificer, knowing that without my mark I could never take my fathers place as Baron, but could one day lead a Cannith Army, if the Korth Edicts continued to fade until they become only a memory of the past. I trained myself in Martial combat and Smithing and my brother often would come visit me at the forge as I worked long hours for no pay. He had manifested his mark early into the tests and was occupied with his baron training and education for most of his days. When we could both get away we would sit together at the docks and pass the time trading stories of our trainings, and I even taught him a thing or two about fighting as he described the politics of the houses.\n\n\nIt was during one of these divagations that a band of rogues took it upon themselves to abduct my brother. They descended upon us like shadows and before we knew it I was on the ground watching them pull my brother away. I felt a surge of panic and anger, and an intolerable pain like a burning brand on my forehead. I had felt hot iron before but this pain was different, worse. I managed to open my eyes through the pain, expecting to see the wielder of this weapon, but as I looked all I saw was a green light, before the darkness at the edge of my vision enveloped me and I lost consciousness.\n\n\nI awoke in the back of a wagon, the words \"Hey, you. You're finally awake\" brought my surroundings into focus. It was one of my father's advisers. He had always been kind to me and often had helped fill the void left by my mother with games of strategy and chance. He was sitting in the back of the wagon with me and explained what had happened. My eyes widened with horror as I learned that the burning I had felt was not a spell used against me, but was rather the manifestation of my dragonmark, my aberrant dragonmark. As the rouges had wrestled with my still struggling brother, I had unleashed a fountain of acid, straight from my forehead, not only severely burning and causing the would be captors to flea, but also disfiguring the arms and legs of my brother, who was only protected by the clothes he wore and the hood the had pulled over his head. He was recovering but had not yet regained consciousness. Upon the discovery of the scene my father had realised the significance of the mark, it meant that I was not in fact his son, but rather the product of unfaithful actions of his departed wife. This and the severe injuries I had caused to my brother meant I was no longer a d'Cannith, and no longer welcome in the House of Cannith. My exile had begun. \n\n\nDuring my exile I turned to religion. Without a purpose anymore I felt that perhaps the Holy path would give me something to focus on, and explored many of the religious organisations throughout east Khorvaire. I never settled on one that felt like it called to me, but I learned about mediation and the power of a peaceful mind. Soon I departed society as a whole and lived in seclusion on the banks of lake glass. There I focused on my mediation and through it realised my psionic powers. I learned that there was a spirit inside of me, the spirit of a warrior. This spirit was what had driven me in my youth to pursue Artificing, and it was the source of my violent dreams. The first time I truly connected to my spirit through meditation my eyes turned a bright red, and they never returned to my mothers light blue. I learned that knowledge was powerful, and traded all I could with other wanders to learn about my spirit, my mark and artificing. Many years past in my solitude, and I learned the nature of my spirit, How to control the powers my mark had given me and how to form magic into my creations. \n\n\nI missed my brother immensely and often tried to reach out to him telepathically, to no avail. I learned little of what became of him and my father. When I did travel into society, small farm communities and the like, I was always met with fear. My mark was always clearly visible on my forehead, and my dark red eyes give me a menacing appearance. I try to always do good for others, but learnt that often the only way to help was to do it without notice, often fabricating devices and spells to assist those in need and departing before anyone even noticed. Humorously to me many of my deeds were considered works of deities, and it appeared I became the silent unknown patron of many local beliefs. I was at peace. \n\n\nOne day in my studies I came across information regarding aberrant dragonmarks. There was supposedly a teacher in the south of khorvaire that could  remove your dragonmark from your skin. I thought to my family, and to all those who feared me because of the mark, and decided to investigate this further. I packed up my belongings and headed out into the world once again. \n\n\n\n</p>","public":"<h1>Background: Hermit</h1><p><p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You lived in seclusion &mdash; either in a sheltered community such as a monastery, or entirely alone &mdash; for a formative part of your life.

To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus&mdash;specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool&mdash;in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an &lsquo;M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,&rdquo; in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of&nbsp;the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability.

An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see &ldquo;<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the <em><a title=\"Dungeon Master’s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a></em>).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day).

As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you look as if you’re producing wonders using mundane items or outlandish inventions.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"ToolsRequired\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Tools Required</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus&mdash;specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool&mdash;in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an &lsquo;M’ component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,&rdquo; in the <em><a title=\"Player’s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player’s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of&nbsp;the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don’t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you’ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC&nbsp;</span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier&nbsp;</span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"RitualCasting\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Artificer","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"sort":700000,"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":1131501,"dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":1,"displayOrder":4,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Artificer"}}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/violet_08.jpg","effects":[]},{"_id":"NkXvs3RqRvD3feFs","name":"Artificer Infusions","type":"feat","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Artificer infusions are extraordinary processes that rapidly turn a nonmagical object into a magic item.</p>\r\n<p>The description of each of the following infusions details the type of object that can receive it, along with whether the resulting magic item requires attunement.</p>\r\n<p>Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level.

If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see &ldquo;<a title=\"Attunement\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/treasure#Attunement\">Attunement</a>&rdquo; in chapter 7 of the&nbsp;<em><a title=\"Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg\">Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide</a></em>).</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion for another one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion immediately ends, and then the new infusion applies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.</p><h3>Summary</h3>Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch up to +2 nonmagical objects, imbuing each of them with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. You can attune yourself to the item the instant you infuse it, or you can forgo attunement so that someone else can attune to the item.  \r\n\r\nYour infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after +2 days. The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion or you exceed your maximum number of infusions.","chat":"Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch up to +2 nonmagical objects, imbuing each of them with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item.

If you roll an odd number, one random creature within 30 feet of you (not including you) takes force damage equal to the number rolled. If no other creatures are in range, you take the damage.<h3>Chaos Bolt</h3><p>You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack’s damage type, as shown below.</p>\r\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\r\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>d8</th>\r\n<th>Damage Type</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td>Acid</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>Cold</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>Fire</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n<td>Force</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>Lightning</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n<td>Poison</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>7</td>\r\n<td>Psychic</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>8</td>\r\n<td>Thunder</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it.

I strayed from my mentor, a priest in his middle years with a soft voice and ring of grey-dappled hair about a balding head, to approach a statue set aside within a shadowed alcove.&nbsp; It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand.&nbsp; I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then.&nbsp; The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew.&nbsp;<br><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity.&nbsp; Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deity’s doctrines.&nbsp; During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or proselytize the words of their goddess or god.&nbsp; Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities.&nbsp;
